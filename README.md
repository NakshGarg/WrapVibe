# WarpVibe - Immersive Starfield Simulation

WarpVibe is a browser-based starfield simulation that creates a mesmerizing warp-speed effect. The application uses HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to render an interactive, customizable starfield that gives users the feeling of traveling through space at light speed.

## Features

- **Dynamic Starfield**: Stars move outward from the center, creating a realistic warp-speed effect
- **Depth Perception**: Varying star speeds and sizes create a sense of depth and dimension
- **Infinite Animation**: Stars reset once they leave the screen for continuous animation
- **Customizable Experience**: Control panel allows users to adjust:
  - Warp Speed: Control how fast stars move
  - Star Color: Choose any color for the stars
  - Star Density: Adjust the number of stars in the field
  - Trail Effect: Control the length of star trails
  - Glow Intensity: Adjust the glow effect around stars
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size or device
- **Smooth Performance**: Optimized for 60fps animation
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies or libraries

## How It Works

WarpVibe uses HTML5 Canvas to create a dynamic starfield simulation:

1. Stars are generated at the center of the screen
2. Each star moves outward in a random direction
3. Stars have varying speeds and sizes to create depth
4. When stars leave the screen, they reset to the center
5. Trail and glow effects enhance the visual experience
6. The animation loop runs at 60fps for smooth performance

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the canvas element and UI controls
- `style.css`: Handles styling for the canvas and UI elements
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the simulation
  - `Star` class: Manages individual star properties and behavior
  - `StarfieldSimulation` class: Controls the overall simulation

## Customization

WarpVibe offers several customization options through the control panel:

- **Warp Speed**: Adjust how fast stars move through space
- **Star Color**: Choose any color for the stars using the color picker
- **Star Density**: Control how many stars appear in the simulation
- **Trail Effect**: Adjust the length and opacity of star trails
- **Glow Intensity**: Control the glow effect around each star

## Browser Compatibility

WarpVibe works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas:

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Tips

- For the best experience, use a modern browser
- If performance is slow, try reducing the Star Density
- On mobile devices, lower Trail Effect and Glow Intensity values may improve performance
